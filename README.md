- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VantaBlack9000

Currenty writing my Master Thesis on the Traveling Salesman Problem. I am trying to build a realistic case for small n, including break times of employees and high trafic zones. Hit me up if you got anything that can probably help me. I am currently searching for a method to calculate and plot a TSP using an actual street network. Therefore I am searching for packages and APIs implementing detailed information on the German street network.
